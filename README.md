# Sirtaki VR Experience

# [Test it here](https://Come31.github.io/sirtaki/index_final.html)

# There are two things we miss more than anything right now: dancing and traveling. This VR experience for the open doors of ENSAAMA brings these two together and invites the spect-actor to dance the sirtaki with our class.

A user wearing the VR headset will live an immersive experience, a flash mob with our virtual class while the other spectators are invited to dance in the real physical space following the steps of the headset wearer.
